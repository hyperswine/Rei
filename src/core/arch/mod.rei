    Utilities for dealing with each fully supported architecture:
    - specific registers and memory mapped registers
    - execution level primitives
    - interrupts and trap primitives
    - memory management primitives

// NOTE: maybe not fully supported per se, as in some primitive features you're still gonna impl yourself
